# Variable: It is a reserved memory location to store value.
In Python, variable refers to a reference variable, when an value
is assign to a variable, it store memory address of that value. 

Arithmetic Operator(+,-,*,/,%,//(floor division),**(exponential))

Type Casting: It is a mechanism to convert one type of reference into another type.
In Python, variables are of dynamic type i.e their is no fixed datatype.so when we assign any 
value to that variable, it datatype depends upon that value type.

if elif(else if) else - Decision making control statement

while _Loop:repitation of code.

For_loop:- '''
range(n):
single arg: start=0 and stop=n-1
-----------------------------------
range(n1,n2)
two arg: start=n1 and stop=n2-1
-----------------------------------
range(n1,n2,step)
three arg: start=n1 , stop=n2-1 and step=more than 1
'''
TwoDList([row][col]) : It is a collection of OneD List.

'''
Dictionary: It is a sequence which is used to store heterogenous data reference, where each data will be given by a key-value pair.
Syntax:
dic = { key:value,key1:value....,keyn:value }
key must be unqiue.
key is immutable and value is mutable.
'''
Tuple: It is a sequence which is used to store bulk amount of heterogenous data , where each data is given by index value used to access and handle data.
Note: Tuple is immutable in nature
Syntax:
tup_name = (e1,e2,....en)
'''
String : It is a sequence capable to store multiple characters,numbers,aplhanumeric data , each element will be given by numeral index value which is used to store and manage string data.
Note: String is immutable in nature.
'''

'''
Function: 
It is a self contained block of statement which is used to perform a particular task.
It is used to reduce code.
Syntax:
def func_name(arguments):
    ...statements
    return return_value
=================
On the basis of return type and arguments, Functions are divided into four type:
1.function without return type and without argument.
2.function without return type and with argument.
3.function with return type and without argument.
4.function with return type and with argument.
'''
Resursion Function: Function calling itself.
5! = 5x4x3x2x1
'''
#In Python , Functions are pass by reference
#Integer,Float,String and Tuple are immutable Objects. so a new object is created in the memory.

'''
File Handling:It is a storage capable to store bulk amount of data simulteneously at particular location.This storage is permanent in nature.i.e once created they can also be accessed and managed manually.
predefined function:
obj = open("file location","mode")

File Mode:
1.write(w):
It checks if file exists or not.If not, created a new file and content can be written.but if file is exists, then it will override file content.
================
2.append(a):It checks if file exists or not.If not, created a new file and content can be written.but if file is exists, then it will add a new content.
================
3.read(r):It checks if file exists or not.If not,it will result in error.If exists, then it will read a file content
================
