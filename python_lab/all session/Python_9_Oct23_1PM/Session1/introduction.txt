#What is Python?

Python: is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language based applications used to develop variety of applications.
It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation.
Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python's Flying Circus

1.) System Software (Network based application: drivers like built in python environment in linux and max)

2.) Science and Numeric Applications:
    a.SciPy – A collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.
    b.Pandas– A data-analysis and modeling library
-------------------------------------
3.) AI based applications
    a.) Machine Learning
    b.) Neural Network
----------------
4.) Data Science
5.) Data Analysis
6.) Cloud based appliactions
7.) Games and 3D Graphics
---------------------------------------
8.) Network Programming:
    a.)Twisted Python – A framework for asynchronous network programming. 
--------------------------------------------------------    
9.) Business:
    a.Python is also a great choice to develop ERP and e-commerce systems.
    b.Odoo – A management software with a range of business applications. With that, it’s an all-rounder and forms a complete suite of enterprise-management applications in-effect.
----------------------------------------------------------
10.) Database Access
    a.)Custom and ODBC interfaces to MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, and others.
---------------------------------------------------------
11.) Robotics
12.) Web Scraping (Harvesting data from websites)

#Features of Python:-
Python is a dynamic, high-level, free open source, and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural-oriented programming. In Python, we don't need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language.
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) It is used to create API(Application Programming Interface) 
using djangorestframework
2.) It is also connect to database we can perform operations like insert,update,delete By default in django we have Sqlite database.
3.) It can be use in different platform (windows,mac,linux) (platform independent)    
5.)Object-Oriented and Procedure-Oriented:
A programming language is object-oriented if it focuses design around data and objects, rather than functions and logic. On the contrary, a programming language is procedure-oriented if it focuses more on functions (code that can be reused). One of the critical Python features is that it supports both object-oriented and procedure-oriented programming. 
-----------------------------------------------------
6. Portable
Python is portable in the sense that the same code can be used on different machines. Suppose you write a Python code on a Mac. If you want to run it on Windows or Linux later, you don’t have to make any changes to it. As such, there is no need to write a program multiple times for several platforms.

#Why Python is interpreted language?
# Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.
# The role of Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is to convert the byte code instructions into machine code so that the computer can execute those machine code instructions and display the final output.

# So PVM is nothing but a software/interpreter that converts the byte code to machine code for given operating system. PVM is also called Python Interpreter and this is the reason Python is called an Interpreted language. We can't see the Byte Code of the program because this happens internally in memory.
#------------------------------------------------------
# Bytecode is computer object code that an interpreter converts into binary machine code so it can be read by a computer's hardware processor.
